This project explores key business metrics using the Superstore dataset. Built in **R** and documented using **Quarto**, it provides actionable insights through statistical modeling, time-series forecasting, and classification.


##  Project Overview

The analysis is centered around 3 real-world business problems:
1. **How do Sales and Discounts impact Profitability?**
2. **Can we accurately forecast future Sales trends?**
3. **What drives Delivery Delays, and how can they be predicted?**

Each is addressed using a combination of visual analytics, machine learning, and statistical techniques.


## Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `forecast`, `patchwork`, `dplyr`
- **Reporting**: Quarto (.qmd)
